>Also, I'll add that if you are using the correct axle nuts, they will be 30mm 12point. 12point is key, as a 6point socket will not fit.

>The socket is under $10 at just about any store for cheap brands. Lowes carries a Kobalt unit for ~$5, and sears keeps them in stock for ~$8. Also, most Pepboys and such will have them as well.
